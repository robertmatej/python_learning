Hi everyone,
My name is Robert, and this is my Python learning repository.
I'm from Poland, and when this is learning repository, some part could be written in Polish language.
Be patient for my code style, soon it will be better ;)


Let's start:
Any part of external programs, files, links, pictures, data from web scraping on this repository are only used for educational purpose. 

Most of code are tasks from ALX bootcamp.


Have a good day :)
